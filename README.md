Sheepshead
==========

3 or 5 player Sheepshead games with up to five of them being human.
See the deployed app at www.simplesheepshead.com

The startup project within the solution is "Sheepshead.React"
Sheepshead - this project won't compile until it has been made dependant on Sheepshead.Logic
Sheepshead.React - uses the React framework
Sheepshead.Logic - has game logic in it and would be usable with a different front-end framework
Sheepshead.Tests - all tests are run on Sheepshead.Logic

Work to do:
* Handle Leasters games that tie.
* Record creation time and last access time for game.

Changes to be considered.
* Question: How do more experienced players achieve finality?
