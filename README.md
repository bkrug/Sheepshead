Sheepshead
==========

3 or 5 player Sheepshead games with up to five of them being human.

The startup projects within the solution are "Sheepshead" and "Sheepshead.React"
Sheepshead - almost no javascript is used
Sheepshead.React - uses the React framework

Work to do:
* Games in memory need to expire after 24 hours of non-use.
* Handle Leasters games that tie.

Changes to be considered.
* Possible: See how other card games online deal with sections.
* Question: How do more experienced players achieve finality?
* Possible: Use sockets instead of repeated ajax calls.
