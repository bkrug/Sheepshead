Sheepshead
==========

3 or 5 player Sheepshead games with up to five of them being human.

ToDo:

* At end-of-hand, let users hover over a score and see what cards were used in each trick.
* Create an additional level of computer player difficulty.
* Going to need to do more stylization improvements, but I'm not sure what.
