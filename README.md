Sheepshead
==========

3 or 5 player Sheepshead games with up to five of them being human.

ToDo:

* At end-of-hand, let users hover over a score and see what cards were used in each trick.
* Create an additional level of computer player difficulty.
* Going to need to do more stylization improvements, but I'm not sure what.

The startup projects within the solution are "Sheepshead" and "Sheepshead.React"

---

Style changes:

* consistent approach to font size
* Add padding for directions. At least as much as the font size.
* Get a better background image, but stick with a non-solid color.
* Possible: Move navigation buttons to the side because you have more realestate there.
* Possible: See how other card games online deal with sections.
* Question: How do more experienced players achieve finality?
* Possible: Use sockets instead of repeated ajax calls.
