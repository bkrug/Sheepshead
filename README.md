Sheepshead
==========

3 or 5 player Sheepshead games with up to five of them being human.

The startup projects within the solution are "Sheepshead" and "Sheepshead.React"

ToDo:

* At end-of-hand, let users hover over a score and see what cards were used in each trick.
* Create an additional level of computer player difficulty.

---

Style changes:

* consistent approach to font size
* Possible: See how other card games online deal with sections.
* Question: How do more experienced players achieve finality?
* Possible: Use sockets instead of repeated ajax calls.
